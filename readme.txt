A custom tool to compare data in tables.

It takes two or more files and reads specified columns.
One of the columns should contain numeric data. The others are treated as labels.
The result is a table where the “label” columns are listed first, then go the data from the first file, and then go the columns containing the difference of the numeric values marked with the same label.
